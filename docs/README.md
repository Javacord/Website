## :bulb: About Javacord

Javacord is a modern library that focuses on simplicity and speed ðŸš€.
By reducing itself to standard Java classes and features like
[`Optional`](wiki/essential-knowledge/optionals.html)s and 
[`CompletableFuture`](wiki/essential-knowledge/completable-futures.html)s, 
it is extremely easy to use for every Java developer, as it does not require you to learn any
 new frameworks or complex abstractions. 
It has rich documentation and an **awesome community** :muscle: on Discord that loves to help with any
specific problems and questions.
